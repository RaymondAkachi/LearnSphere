  Students can add new subjects (e.g., SS2 Math, JSS3 Biology) by downloading lightweight `.learn` content packs.

- 📴 **Works Entirely Offline**  
  Once installed, LearnSphere runs fully without internet — ideal for rural schools, low-income areas, or devices without consistent access.

- 📊 **Progress Tracking**
